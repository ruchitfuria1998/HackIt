Project Abstract:
	With hectic schedules it is difficult to maintain a track of your expenses in day to day life.
Existing expense tracker applications require a fair amount of inputs from the user.
And hence one needs a tool which can help one in getting insight into his income and expenditure. Keeping
this in mind the said application keeps a record of all your expenses by automatically categorizing them 
into various sectors where one can spend and thereby help in moderating the balance between income and 
expenses. The application also provides graphical analysis where you can compare your income and expenses, and 
also visualize the expenditure in a paritcular sector.
